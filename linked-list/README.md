# Singly Linked List
 ##we to do the implementation of a singly Linked List and some methods (insert,includes,tostring)
## Challenge
1. Create a Linked List class
2. insert in 
3. display
4. looking  in 
## Approach & Efficiency
o(1) for all function
## API
1. Insert(int data) method that takes an integer value as argument,then creates a new node .

2. Includes(int data) method that loops through the linked list using a temp pointer to search for a searched data and returns true if it's found, otherwise it returns false. The condition of this loop is to keep iterating until the pointer reaches to null.

3. tostring() method that returns the data of each node as a formatted string after it concatenates them inside a string using a while loop to traverse the whole linked list.
